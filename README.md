# Full-Stack-Open-part-5
Submissions for FSO part 

All exercises will be on the same branch so I can get my contribution squares

## Exercise 5.1
Followed the story closely. User cannot log out unless the app is restarted.

## Exercise 5.2
Simple login/logout, just added localStorage calls.

## Exercise 5.3
New blogs have the default value of 0 likes. Otherwise, just followed the story.

## Exercise 5.4
Added Notification component from previous parts. Added CSS file for coloring.

## Exercise 5.5
Followed the story closely, but had a few small issues (syntax errors, Togglable not liking the array).

## Exercise 5.6
BlogForm was extracted into its own component during 5.5.

## Exercise 5.7
Blogs can now be expanded. Placed a like button, but it isn't working yet. Didn't wrap the blog title and author in a `<div>` like in the example.

## Exercise 5.8
Blogs can now be liked (multiple times). Not sure if I used the right method for updating an item in the `blogs` array, but it works.

## Exercise 5.9
Blogs are now sorted by likes. Maybe a loop could be used instead of the `sort` method when liking only a single post, but using `sort` looks cleaner.  
Apparently Mongoose can also return a sorted query. (not used in this exercise)

## Exercise 5.10
Note that blogs are only deleted on the frontend. Using `filter` to delete items rather than `splice`.

## Exercise 5.11
Not sure how to format proptypes for objects.
